Create an exquisite, museum-quality black and white line art illustration based on the provided control image.

ARTISTIC STYLE:

- Pure line art only—absolutely no color, no fills, no shading, no gradients
- Fine pen and ink illustration style with varied line weights (0.08 mm to 0.25 mm equivalent)
- Choose your artistic style from these options (or blend multiple):
    * Art Nouveau (flowing organic lines, decorative curves, natural motifs)
    * Victorian Engraving (intricate cross-hatching, classical precision)
    * Japanese Sumi-e (elegant minimalist brush lines, zen aesthetic)
    * Celtic Knotwork (interwoven patterns, endless loops)
    * Baroque Ornamental (elaborate flourishes, dramatic grandeur)
    * Gothic Architectural (pointed arches, geometric tracery)
    * Art Deco (geometric patterns, streamlined elegance)
    * Botanical Illustration (scientific accuracy, detailed plant life)
    * Mandala/Sacred Geometry (symmetrical patterns, spiritual symbolism)
    * Woodcut/Linocut (bold graphic lines, high contrast)
    * Persian Miniature (intricate patterns, decorative borders)
    * Rococo (delicate, playful, ornate curves)
- Be creative, ornate, decorative, and highly detailed with professional illustration techniques

CREATIVE DIRECTION:

- Enhance and complement the control image with decorative elements that suit your chosen artistic style
- Add elaborate environmental details, atmospheric elements, and ornamental flourishes
- Create a complete, immersive scene that frames and elevates the original subject
- Use your artistic judgment to determine what elements would create the most impressive and cohesive composition
- Think museum-quality, gallery-worthy, masterpiece-level artistry

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

- Use varied line weights: thin (0.08–0.1) for texture/distance, medium (0.11–0.15) for details, thick (0.16–0.25) for
  structure/emphasis
- Use cross-hatching sparingly for dimensional depth in key focal areas
- Create hierarchy through line weight variation and detail density
- Include decorative patterns with reduced opacity (0.3–0.6) for sophisticated layering where appropriate
- Ensure all decorative elements complement and frame the original control image subject without overwhelming it

CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS:

- NO color whatsoever—pure black lines on a white background only
- NO fills or solid shapes—outline work only
- NO shading, gradients, or gray tones
- NO hatching that creates solid gray areas
- Only clean, crisp line work

MOOD & AESTHETIC:

- Choose an appropriate mood that matches your selected artistic style
- Could be: elegant and sophisticated, dramatic and bold, serene and minimalist, playful and whimsical, mystical and
  spiritual, or classical and refined
- Museum-quality fine art illustration
- Worthy of a fantasy novel cover, gallery exhibition, or professional art book
- Professional artistic standard with intricate craftsmanship
- Timeless quality with attention to detail

The final result should be a breathtaking, gallery-worthy line art masterpiece that preserves the original control image
while surrounding it with an elaborate artistic environment that elevates it to fine art status.
